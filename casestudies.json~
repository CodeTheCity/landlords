<b>Artists up and down the UK have transformed empty spaces into temporary creative spaces. These spaces include both commercial and domestic properties. </b>

Manchester, England http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7252/784/1600/lamport%20court.0.jpg

Apartment was an artist led project and exhibition space in a one-bedroom council flat in a sixties tower block in central Manchester. Artists showed work alongside the everyday objects in the flat. http://apartmentmanchester.blogspot.co.uk

Luton, England http://media.meanwhilespace.com/media/images/Luton_-_Project_jpg_1280x800_crop_q85.jpg

Meanwhilespace, a project that promotes and facilitates use of empty spaces, mainly in and around London, used empty units for art to revitalise a street in Luton. Project leaders worked with private landlords negotiate a 6-week lease for 3 vacant units on High Town Road in Luton, during the 6-week period several projects worked within the spaces to create a community focused art hub. Following the 6-week period, High Town Art For All went on to sign extensions to the leases on the 3 units on High Town Road and continued to make the spaces available to 29 artists for a further 6 months. After periods of long-term vacancy, all units have since been re-let on a commercial basis. 

Wrexham, Wales http://venues.skiddlecdn.co.uk/5/55365_1_un-deg-un-arts-space-wrexham_3.jpg

When JJB Sports went into administration, art project UnDegUn (eleven, in English) transformed the unused city centre space into a creative hub for exhibitions, gigs, workshops and spoken word nights. The space included a break-out area as well as studio space that could be rented for Â£15 a week. "An empty shop is of no use to anyone and has an impact on the High Street. Having a creative and visually attractive things in those spaces has a benefit to the entire environment of Wrexham. It acts as a bit of an attraction in itself."

In 1999, Sorcha Dallas and Marianne Greated launched a project called Switchspace, which consisted of an art gallery in the front room of Dallas' flat. 15 months and 15 shows later, the duo brokered a deal with property agency Fab Flats which allowed them to show work in vacant properties in the city. This has led to Switchspace becoming a charity and inspiring other artists to start exhibitions in their homes.
