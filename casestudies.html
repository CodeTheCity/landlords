Case Studies

Artists up and down the UK have transformed empty spaces into temporary creative spaces. These spaces include both commercial and domestic properties. 

Manchester, England

Apartment was an artist led project and exhibition space in a one-bedroom council flat in a sixties tower block in central Manchester. Artists showed work alongside the everyday objects in the flat. http://apartmentmanchester.blogspot.co.uk

Luton, England

Meanwhilespace, a project that promotes and facilitates use of empty spaces, mainly in and around London, used empty units for art to revitalise a street in Luton. Project leaders worked with private landlords negotiate a 6-week lease for 3 vacant units on High Town Road in Luton, during the 6-week period several projects worked within the spaces to create a community focused art hub. Following the 6-week period, High Town Art For All went on to sign extensions to the leases on the 3 units on High Town Road and continued to make the spaces available to 29 artists for a further 6 months. After periods of long-term vacancy, all units have since been re-let on a commercial basis. 

Wrexham, Wales

When JJB Sports went into administration, art project UnDegUn (eleven, in English) transformed the unused city centre space into a creative hub for exhibitions, gigs, workshops and spoken word nights. The space included a break-out area as well as studio space that could be rented for Â£15 a week. "An empty shop is of no use to anyone and has an impact on the High Street. Having a creative and visually attractive things in those spaces has a benefit to the entire environment of Wrexham. It acts as a bit of an attraction in itself." 

Glasgow, Scotland 

In 1999, Sorcha Dallas and Marianne Greated launched a project called Switchspace, which consisted of an art gallery in the front room of Dallas' flat. 15 months and 15 shows later, the duo brokered a deal with property agency Fab Flats which allowed them to show work in vacant properties in the city. This has led to Switchspace becoming a charity and inspiring other artists to start exhibitions in their homes.
