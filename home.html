<h2>Landlords Love Creatives</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Calling all Aberdeen based landlords and creatives…lets get you guy’s together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This site is for landlords with available spaces and creatives seeking spaces, helping bring you together in perfect harmony. So if you are a landlord or gatekeeper for a space which may be available, or a creative or creative business looking for space, please read on.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Benefits to Landlords</h3>
<p></p>
<p>By opening up your spaces you can achieve the following.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Increasing occupancy</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Creatives are creative what space they can use, small, large, in need to repair or in an unfashionable part of town…these can all come alive. If you have a venue or space within a venue which is difficult to occupy, then creatives could be what you are looking for.
<p></p>
<h3>Savings on rates</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Did you know that creative businesses and artists can qualify for lower business rates? If you have an empty building, then occupying this with a creative could reduce your costs!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Property value</h3>
<p></p>
<p>If you are seeking to make your property more attractive, perhaps even increase its value, then a creative could be help. Creatives are commonly seeking temporary use of space, helping animate the space and highlight its potential to prospective buyers or longer term leases.
<p></p>
<h3>Redevelopment/maintenance of your space</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Creatives have skills and are not afraid to use them. If you have a space which requires development or some aesthetic improvements, then a creative may be able to help.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Grants</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Both Aberdeen City Council and Creative Scotland offer small capital development programmes for creatives which could be used to redevelop your space.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Income with potential for growth</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The creative industries is an increasingly important and economically important part of the city’s economy. Providing a creative with access to space could not only bring in immediate income but provide a basis for growth in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Wider benefits to the city</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We all want Aberdeen to be a vibrant and exciting city right? Well creatives can help make this happen, helping make the city a better place to invest, live and visit.</p>
